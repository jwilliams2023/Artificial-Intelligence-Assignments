# Artificial Intelligence Assignments

This repository contains assignments for the **COMP 5600 Artificial Intelligence** course at Auburn University. The assignments cover a range of foundational AI topics, including but not limited to:

- Introduction to Intelligent Agents  
- Search Algorithms  
- Knowledge Representation and Reasoning  
- Machine Learning  
- Deep Learning  

The purpose of this repository is not only to showcase the work and knowledge I gained from this class but also to enhance my skills in:

- Git and GitHub  
- VSCode  
- Jupyter Notebooks  
- Anaconda and environment management  
- Cross-platform functionality  

As a student using a Mac for school and a Windows PC at home, I developed these skills on both machines, learning to maintain consistency and functionality across platforms. To support reproducibility and modularity, I created separate Conda environments for each assignment, starting from **Assignment 0**.

Feel free to explore and use this repository as a reference or learning resource (my professor explicitly allowed this)
